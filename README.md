# Handwritten_Character_Recognition
### Problem Statement
A medical company needs to take handwritten prescription and retrieve the text from it. To do this manually, it will require a lot of time and lots of cost to the company. So, the company wants to automate this task. I need to create a neural network model that will take images as input, read the text images, and convert it into digital text. To solve this problem, I created a CNN LSTM model.
