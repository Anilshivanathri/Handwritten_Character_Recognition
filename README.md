# Handwritten_Character_Recognition
### Problem Statement
A medical company needs to take handwritten prescription and retrieve the text from it. To do this manually, it will require a lot of time and lots of cost to the company. So, the company wants to automate this task. I need to create a neural network model that will take images as input, read the text images, and convert it into digital text. To solve this problem, I created a CNN LSTM model.
### Strategy
The project has 4major components:  
1. Preprocess image and text data
2. Implementation of CNN layers to extract features
3. Implementation of RNN(Bi-LSTM) layers to the sequence model
4. CTC_loss and CTC_decode
